## Introduction
This program counts how long you are using a computer. It starts from first login or bootup (windows 10 fast startup is messing results). It shows how much time elapsed and  left. It will notify when wanted time left and a period before it ends.

## Usage
Download binary from releases and add *startup-timer.exe* to autostart.
If you want to change some values, then take a look to *appsettings.json*
Remove *Work.NotifyBeforeEnd* if you don't want to receive notification before time ends
